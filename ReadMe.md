### Baybayin Transliterator
#### MPOP Reverse II (Ryann Kim Sesgundo)

> This package is just the same with the api I've created before. But I redevelop this with different algorithm.

*Note*
> This version has the new version of algorithm, still in test, but it works on me. If you found out some bugs, kindly create an issue on my github repository, or just email me @ weryses19@gmail.com or message us [on facebook](https://facebook.com/MPOP.ph)

### how to use baybay(String data)
``` NodeJS
const baybayin = require("baybayin-transliterator")

console.log(baybayin("Kamusta"))
```

> I'm still trying to make this more accurate based on the baybayin script that I'd studied before. Regarding to the development, this is just a beta test, and still I want to gather some feedbacks too. I've created this as a package just only for facebook bot developers, also to the telegram bot developers out there.
